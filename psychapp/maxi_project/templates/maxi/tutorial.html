<h1>Syllogism Tutorial</h1>
<h2>Please take the time necessary to understand the content of this short tutorial on solving categorical syllogisms.</h2>

<h3>What it means for an argument to valid</h3>
<p> When we reason, we are concerned with statements about the world, such as "It is raining outside."
A statement about the world can be thought of as a variable whose value is either 
"true" or "false." Its value could be determined by observation, without abstract reasoning 
(look outside of the window: <i>is</i> it raining?). If so, the statement is known as a <b>premise</b>.</p>


<p>Alternatively, the value of a statement can be <i>deduced</i> from such premise. In that case, the statement is referred to as
a <b>conclusion</b>. Premise-statements and conclusion-statements therefore play
different roles in an argument. Premises provide the input; the conclusion the output. </p>

<p> For an argument to be useful, it needs to be <b>valid</b>. This has a precise meaning: 
in a valid argument, it is impossible for the
premises to be true at the same time as the conclusion is false. The truth of the
premises <i>implies</i> that the conclusion is true.</p>

<h3>Categorical statements</h3>
<p>A <b>categorical</b> statement is one that relates two categories, by asserting that
either all or part of the first class is included or excluded from the other. 
For categories A and B, this means that there are four different types of statement:</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li><b>All A are B:</b>Category A is wholly included in Category B </li>
	<li><b>Some A are B:</b>There exists at least one element in A that is included in B</li>
	<li><b>No A are B:</b>Category A is wholly excluded from Category B</li>
	<li><b>Some A are not B:</b>There exists at least one element in A that is excluded from B</li>
</ul>
These four different types ("All", "Some", "No" and "Some-not") can be visualised through "Euler diagrams":</p>

<div style="float:left;border: 1px solid black;padding-top: 10px;"><img src="{% static "images/SomeAareBeuler.png" %}" alt="SomeAareBeuler" /></div>

</div>


<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
<p>In an Euler diagram, overlap means class inclusion and a cross means "There must exist an individual in this area for the statement to be true". 
For example, the "Some A are B" statement means that there exists at least one element inside A that is also in B, but "All A are B" does <i>not</i>
mean that there must actually exist an element inside A (hence no cross there).</p>
<div>
<h3>Categorical syllogisms</h3>
<p>
A <b>categorical syllogism</b> is an argument that has two premises and one conclusion. They are also limited to
three different categories, which we may call A, B and C. The first premise is concerned with A and B, the second
with B and C, and the conclusion is concerned with C and A.</p>

For example:
<p><b>All A are B</b></p>
<p><b>No C are B</b></p>
<p><b>-------------</b></p>
<p><b>Therefore, no C are A</b></p>
</div>

<p>Valid conclusions can be of the four categorical types, always in the order of C-A:</p>

<ul>
	<li>All C are A</li>
	<li>Some A are B</li>
	<li>No A are B</li>
	<li>Some A are not B</li>
</ul>

<p>If none of these follow from the premises, there is no valid conclusion. The syllogism structure is shown below:</p>

<div><img src="{% static "images/structure.png" %}" alt="structure" /></div>

{% ifequal condition "1" %}

<h3>Euler Diagrams</h3>

<p> Euler diagrams can be used to determine which conclusions are valid from two premises.</p>
<ol>
<li>Depict each premise as an Euler diagram.</li>
<li>Combine the two premise diagrams by making the B circles correspond (they refer, after all, to the same term).</li>
<li>Check if any of the possible valid conclusions is true for the resultant diagram.</li>
<li>If not, decide that no valid conclusion exists.</li>
</ol>

<p>An example is shown below. By unifying the diagrams for "No B are A" and "All C are B", we can read off that "No C are A",
 as the C and A circles are necessarily non-overlapping.</p>

<div><img src="{% static "images/animation1.gif" %}" alt="animation1" /></div>

<p>Sometimes there are several ways of combining the diagrams. To make drawing conclusions easier, 
it is preferred that we choose a combination that is consistent with the individual diagram meanings.
In the example below, with premises "No B are A" and "Some C are B", there would be no point in making 
all the three circles overlap, because we know from premise 1 that the A and B circles aren't supposed to overlap.
Thus we can easily read off that "Some C are not A", because A and B are non-overlapping, yet C definitely has a member
 that is also in B.</p>

<div><img src="{% static "images/animation2.gif" %}" alt="animation2" /></div>

<p>Besides being consistent with the premises, the rule of thumb is to select the arrangement that creates the most subregions, 
for it represents the maximum number of types. That way, we make sure not to forget any logically possible element.</p>

<p>In the example below, with premises "All B are A" and "Some C are B", we could combine the diagrams such that A encircles both 
C and B, but that way we don't represent elements that may be in C but not A - a possibility that the premises permit.
By following th rule of thumb, we can read that some C are definitely A.</p>

<div><img src="{% static "images/animation3.gif" %}" alt="animation3" /></div>

<p>Diagrams can help detect whether or not a valid conclusion actually exists for the given premises. In the result diagram below,
 none of the possible conclusions follow logically. We can't say that "Some C are A" or that "Some C are not A" because there is 
 no cross in the relevant regions. Nor can we say that "All C are A" or "No C are A", because the diagram allows both that
 C is contained within A and completely excluded from it.</p>

<div><img src="{% static "images/animation4.gif" %}" alt="animation4" /></div>

<p>In the example below, the premises "Some A are not B" and "All B are C" do not give us information about where to place the cross
 when unifying the diagrams. As a result, we cannot draw any valid conclusion.</p>

<div><img src="{% static "images/animation5.gif" %}" alt="animation5" /></div>

<p>As a final example, consider the following diagram unification. Again, no valid conclusion in the C-A order can be drawn (it does not
 follow that "All C are A".) </p>

<h2>Your Task</h2>
<p>You will now be given a set of syllogistic problems.

<p>Once you start the experiment, you will not be able to revisit the tutorial.</p>

<p>Please answer as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>
